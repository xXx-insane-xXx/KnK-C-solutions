# Solutions to KnK C book

## Know more: 
1. This repo contains probably decent enough solutions. How bad can my code be?
2. I am currently only uploading projects of each chapters.
3. Solutions of projects from chapter 7 will be uploaded here as I lost my previous chapters code base cause my arch linux broke :). And I was resistent to git and github for until then somewhat.
